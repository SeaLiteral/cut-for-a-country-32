# Cut for a Country

A homebrew fighting game for the PS1, made using PSn00bSDK.

Controls in game:
- Cross to punch.
- Circle to dash.
- L1 and R1 to zoom out and in.
- Dpad to move left and right. Up jumps, but there's no use for jumping.

Controls after a battle:
- Start to start a new battle.
- Select to change the text language.

Known issues:
- The Spanish translation shows wrong if player two wins and partially goes out of the screen.
- Text doesn't show correctly in DuckStation. So I recommend playing in PCSX Redux instead if you want to easily be able to understand the text.
